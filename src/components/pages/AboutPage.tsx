Few artists can claim that their debut single is about cake. Jacob Blackfly can, though that doesn’t mean 
desserts are the only thing he talks about in his self-produced indie-pop songs. Born and bred in Brussels 
with Finnish roots and currently living in Helsinki, Jacob Blackfly grew up surrounded by a mix of vintage 
and contemporary pop, classical music and classic rock and blues, before later discovering electronic music 
and RnB (Adele, Corinne Bailey Rae, AC/DC, The Beatles, Rufus Du Sol, Moonchild). These genres have each 
left their mark on Jacob’s sound, which includes piano ballads with an electronic touch, pop-rock and even 
90s-style hip hop, keeping a consistent focus on catchy melodies and memorable grooves. June 2025 saw the 
release of Jacob’s 4-track debut EP “Searching”, which includes the singles “Avoidant”, “Searching” and “180 Degrees”, 
as well as music videos for the latter 2. The EP has garnered 2000+ streams across platforms. Jacob is also 
co-writing and producing a single “Leikitään” with Kultapoiki, due to come out late 2025. Lastly, Jacob is 
actively gigging in Helsinki to promote his music (most recently at Käpygrilli and Linna Bar in June 2025) 
and as a band member in other musicians’ projects. Kallio Block Party and Herttoniemi Block Party founder, 
member of Kontula Electronic working group Mikko Heinänen comments on Jacob’s music (Feb 2025): “Jacob has 
a clearly distinctive voice in his songs.”
